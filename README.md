eigendrums is a pure data hack that lets you trigger different (drum) samples by arbitrary (drum-like) trigger sounds. It may be used to turn your body into a small hip hop sample kit!

Howto
=====

- download and install pure data [http://puredata.info/community/projects/software/pd-extended]
- open `main.pd` in pure data
- connect a microphone and headphones, edit audio settings if necessary
- "learn 10" triggers learning: hit each "trigger sound" 10 times.
- "learn 0" stops the learning.
- that's it. you can play it now...

- guess what "forget" does.


ToDo
====

Better UI, optional MIDI output, refining parameters etc.
